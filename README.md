### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in Front End Development. My passions include CSS, Semantic HTML, Website Accessibility, and development frameworks such as Next.JS and React.JS, just to name a few.

I went to a coding bootcamp at the University of California, Irvine where I learned Full Stack Web Development and collaborated on various web applications.

I'm currently working on solidfying my frontend skills through Front End Mentor, a website with a collection of Front End projects for new and experienced developers alike. Afterwards, I plan to increase my existing knowledge of Back-End technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.

I'm also planning to upskill in Mobile Application Development. :iphone:

I'm looking to collaborate on any web applications and/or mobile applications. :iphone: :computer:

**Fun fact:** I am an avid fan of Japanese animation. :tokyo_tower: :japan: I am also very interested in learning about Cybersecurity, and plan to study it soon.

Below, are a list of my repositories that have projects I worked on and currently working on.
