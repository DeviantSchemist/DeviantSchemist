### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in Front End Development. My passions include CSS, Semantic HTML, Website Accessibility, and development frameworks such as Next.JS and React.JS, just to name a few.

I went to a coding bootcamp at the University of California, Irvine where I learned Full Stack Web Development and collaborated on various web applications.
